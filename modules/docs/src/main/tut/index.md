A library for retrying actions that can fail.

Designed to work with [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) and (optionally)
[cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) or [Monix](https://monix.io/) 
and even compatible with [ZIO](https://zio.dev/).

Inspired by the [retry Haskell
package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retry).

Get started with [Getting
started](https://cb372.github.io/cats-retry/docs/index.html)!
