# cats-retry

A library for retrying actions that can fail.

Designed to work with [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) and (optionally)
[cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) or [Monix](https://monix.io/).

Inspired by the [retry Haskell
package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retry).
